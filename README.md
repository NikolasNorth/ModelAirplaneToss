# Model Airplane Toss

### How To Install
Model Airplane Toss is built using Pygame and thus we will need to install the pygame module prior to playing.
Steps:
- Ensure you have `pip` installed on your system. (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#installing-with-get-pip-py)
- Go to directory containing `requirements.txt`
- From your terminal, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- At this point the pygame module should be installed.

### How To Execute

### How To Play
- When you launch the game, you will be brought to the welcome screen.
- Press the spacebar to start playing the game.
- Keep clicking the space bar to ensure your airplane remains in the air.
- Guide your airplane through the openings between the set of green pipes.
- For each successful pass through the gap, you will earn +1 point. The goal is to try and earn as many points as possible before dying.
- The game will be over once the airplane either makes contact with a green pipe, or hits the top of the game window, or bottom of the game window.
